# TODO for week of 10/4/22

This repo contains the R package for out method.

There are two main files to run analyses on this repo: cp_sim.R and ci_sim.R.  ci_sim.R is an updated version of the file you were running previously while cp_sim.R is an abbreviated version that only calculates coverage probability.  We created this is designing simulation studies.

For next week go to Simulations/Cluster Scripts:

* This is an example of how to run cp_sim.R 

* Start by getting this to run on the cluster

* Then create analogous files for ci_sim.R and repeat Setting 1a (balanced) that you performed last week using the old version of the code

* Create a markdown file summarizing coverage probability and confidence interval length that contains these results as well as the old version you ran last week
